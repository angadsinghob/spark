                There are people who are facing hunger in your community. Hunger exists in every state and county in India. Your local food banks, shelters, and soup kitchens rely on the donations they receive from people like you to help keep their shelves stocked. Food drives are also a great way to raise awareness about hunger and  inspire others to take action.
